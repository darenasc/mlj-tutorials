# Julia programming language

## Type inference 

Type annotation is not necessary in the code but it makes the code readable. *Type inference* is the process of identifying the types of the arguments to dispatch the right method. The *multiple dispatch* Julia feature make programs more efficient.

# MLJ

MLJ (Machine Learning in Julia) is a toolbox written in Julia providing a common interface and meta-algorithms for selecting, tuning, evaluating, composing and comparing machine learning models written in Julia and other languages. MLJ is released under the MIT licensed and sponsored by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

### The MLJ Universe

The functionality of MLJ is distributed over a number of repositories
illustrated in the dependency chart below.
